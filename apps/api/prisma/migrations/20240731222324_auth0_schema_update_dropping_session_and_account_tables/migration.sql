/*
  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `picture` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `emailVerified` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - You are about to drop the `Account` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `Session` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Made the column `auth0Id` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
