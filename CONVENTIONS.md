- Use type annotations everywhere possible to enhance code clarity and type safety.
- Use [Zod](https://zod.dev) for type definition and validation.
- Use functional components over class components in React.
- Prefer TailwindCSS for styling over plain CSS and always use `packages/ui` directory package for creating UI components that later should be used in all project apps.
- Use root environment variables for configuration and secrets management.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Organize components by feature or domain in the `components` directory inside of `packages/ui` directory.
- Ensure that CI/CD pipelines include linting, testing, and build steps.
- For frontend use NextJS at least at version 14 or later.
- For backend use NextJS at least at version 14 or later.
- For NextJS code use App Router and never use Page Router as it's legacy.
- For coding always use TypeScript
- For writing UI components you must use NextUI and build custome components in `packages/ui` directory.
- For visualizing the UI package and available components from `packages/ui` use Storybook inside the package.
- For authentication, use [Clerk](https://clerk.com).
- For analytics, use RudderStack and GrowthBook.
- For monorepo management, use Turborepo.
- For database interactions, use Prisma with ZenStack which interacts with PostgreSQL database.
- For testing, use Cypress and Vitest.
- For CI/CD, use Husky for managing Git hooks.
- For deployment, use Vercel.
- For containerization, use Docker.
- For package management always use pnpm only.
- For writing and documenting APIs use Swagger and OpenAPI.
- For project workspace and directories always use monorepo managed by Turborepo where we have `packages` and `apps` directories within wich we have individual apps inside `apps` directory (e.g., web, api, admin) and reusable packages that can be used in apps defined in `packages` directory (e.g., ui, auth, analytics).
- Prefer the latest recommendations from the frameworks and libraries listed above (e.g., use App Router in NextJS 14+). Never suggest code based on outdated or previous versions of frameworks.
- For icons always use Phosphor icons package.
- Always refer to `.documentation` directory at the begining of chat session and keep its context for the entire conversation as this folder contains the latest documentation for all frameworks I want to use in this project.
