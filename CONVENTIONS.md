- Use root environment variables for configuration and secrets management.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Organize components by feature or domain in the `components` directory.
- Ensure that CI/CD pipelines include linting, testing, and build steps.
- For authentication, use Auth0.
- For analytics, use RudderStack and GrowthBook.
- For monorepo management, use Turborepo.
- For database interactions, use Prisma with ZenStack.
- For testing, use Cypress and Vitest.
- For CI/CD, use Husky for managing Git hooks.
- For deployment, use Vercel.
- For containerization, use Docker.
- Prefer the latest recommendations from the frameworks and libraries listed above (e.g., use App Router in NextJS 14+).
